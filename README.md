# 3D Audio Intergrated Car Game

# Overview
This project focuses on creating an immersive audio experience using 3D sound principles. The goal is to leverage Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to simulate spatial audio cues that mimic real-world phenomena in a Car driving Game or Simulation. The movement of sound is handled with precision, taking into consideration the velocity of moving objects in the simulation. As objects pass by the listener, the sound dynamically pans from one ear to the other, reflecting real-world movement. The code in written in python programming language and the pygame library has been utilized for the creation of car simulation.
